# Analysis of Burning Man Census Decompression data.
Author: Gridge, 2018

The data analysis for 2018 SF Decom was performed using python with numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries.
The jupyter notebook with all the data analysis details can be found in this repository.

The R analysis routine is also here, although it's not complete yet (and likely may never be).
